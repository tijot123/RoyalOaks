<body style="color:#fff; font-size:1rem"><p>Royal Oaks Country Club was organized in August 1945 by a group of
    50 downtown businessmen who wanted to make a dream come true. Each individual put up $1,000 and
    purchased 170 acres of land near Orchards - the home of the first nine holes. Royal Oaks was
    open for play in 1947 as a member owned club. The second nine was opened in 1952 and a new
    clubhouse followed.</p>

<p>The key ingredient in the early days were the hard working members who donated countless
    materials and labor to the building of the course and clubhouse. Because the ground was quite
    rocky, many of these members were known as "rock pickers" because they would go out on the
    fairways and pick up rocks.</p>

<p>Royal Oaks has always been known as a long, tough tree-lined golf course. It is a popular
    tournament site and has hosted all major Northwest tournaments. Recent tournaments include the
    PNGA Amateur where Tiger Woods won in 1994 and Nick Flanagan in 2003. Like Tiger, Nick went on
    to win the U.S. Amateur the same year. </p>

<p>Royal Oaks is host of one of the top amateur tournaments in the Northwest. The Royal Oaks
    Invitational Tournament (ROIT) is a three day, 54-hole individual stroke play tournament that
    features three divisions: Championship, Junior/Senior and Senior. Dick Yost won the ROIT in it's
    inaugural year in 1957. Past winners include Peter Jacobsen, Dave Glenz and Jonathan Moore. </p>

<p>Royal Oaks still remains a member owned club and we're proud of the rock pickers and our founding
    members that donated their time and resources. </p></body>
